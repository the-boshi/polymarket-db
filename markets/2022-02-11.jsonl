(To see the candlestick close price, click the candlestick icon, and observe the number after the “C:” when you hover over a candlestick for a given time period.)  \n\nYou can use the calculator to the right (underneath the Buy modal) to calculate how each Long or Short Token price corresponds with the relevant cryptocurrency’s price. Long and Short shares will settle proportionally to the outcome value’s position within the upper and lower bound, if the final value is between these bounds. But if the final outcome value exceeds either the upper or lower bound, the price of each Outcome Token is capped at $1 and $0.", "resolutionSource": "https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ethereum", "startDate": "2022-02-11T00:00:00Z", "creationDate": "2022-02-11T00:00:00Z", "endDate": "2022-03-10T00:00:00Z", "image": "https://polymarket-upload.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/what-will-the-price-of-ethereum-eth-be-on-march-10-2022-1d35285d-c904-43ed-bdcb-724be5281214.png", "icon": "https://polymarket-upload.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/what-will-the-price-of-ethereum-eth-be-on-march-10-2022-1d35285d-c904-43ed-bdcb-724be5281214.png", "active": true, "closed": true, "archived": false, "new": false, "featured": false, "restricted": true, "liquidity": 0, "volume": 56366.41, "openInterest": 0, "sortBy": "ascending", "category": "Crypto", "published_at": "2022-07-27 14:41:21.009+00", "createdAt": "2022-07-27T14:41:21.012Z", "updatedAt": "2024-04-23T06:34:22.93699Z", "competitive": 0, "volume24hr": 0, "volume1wk": 0, "volume1mo": 0, "volume1yr": 0, "liquidityAmm": 0, "liquidityClob": 0, "commentCount": 686, "series": [{"id": "42", "ticker": "ethereum-multi-strikes-weekly", "slug": "ethereum-multi-strikes-weekly", "title": "Ethereum Multi Strikes Weekly", "subtitle": "ETH", "seriesType": "single", "recurrence": "weekly", "image": "https://polymarket-upload.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/eth+icon.png", "icon": "https://polymarket-upload.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/ETH.png", "layout": "default", "active": true, "closed": false, "archived": false, "new": false, "featured": false, "restricted": true, "publishedAt": "2023-03-23 23:53:38.897+00", "createdBy": "15", "updatedBy": "17", "createdAt": "2023-03-23T23:44:07.798Z", "updatedAt": "2025-11-09T22:07:17.676172Z", "commentsEnabled": false, "competitive": "0", "volume24hr": 0, "volume": 515645.186544, "liquidity": 1482223.34179, "startDate": "2021-01-01T17:00:00Z", "pythTokenID": "0xff61491a931112ddf1bd8147cd1b641375f79f5825126d665480874634fd0ace", "cgAssetName": "ethereum", "commentCount": 624}], "cyom": false, "closedTime": "2022-07-27T14:41:21.012Z", "showAllOutcomes": false, "showMarketImages": true, "enableNegRisk": false, "seriesSlug": "eth-weeklies", "negRiskAugmented": false, "pendingDeployment": false, "deploying": false}], "creator": "", "ready": false, "funded": false, "cyom": false, "competitive": 0, "pagerDutyNotificationEnabled": false, "approved": true, "rewardsMinSize": 0, "rewardsMaxSpread": 0, "spread": 1, "oneDayPriceChange": 0, "oneHourPriceChange": 0, "oneWeekPriceChange": 0, "oneMonthPriceChange": 0, "oneYearPriceChange": 0, "lastTradePrice": 0, "bestBid": 0, "bestAsk": 1, "clearBookOnStart": true, "manualActivation": false, "negRiskOther": false, "umaResolutionStatuses": "[]", "pendingDeployment": false, "deploying": false, "rfqEnabled": false, "holdingRewardsEnabled": false, "feesEnabled": false}
