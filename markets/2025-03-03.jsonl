Otherwise, this market will resolve to “No”.\n\nTrump’s disapproval rating must be higher than his approval rating, ties will not qualify.\n\nThe approval/disapproval ratings for each date will be considered finalized once the next data point is available. If data for any date remains unavailable, the nearest previous approval/disapproval figures will be used.\n\nThe resolution source will be FiveThirtyEight's rating poll aggregator, https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/approval/donald-trump/, specifically the disapproval rating indicated by the purple \"disapprove\", and the green “approve” trend line for the resolution date. The box that 538 uses to calculate the difference using different precision is not relevant for this market - only the difference between approval and disapproval ratings that they report up to one decimal point is considered.\n\nChanges in the methodology by which FiveThirtyEight calculates the disapproval rating will have no bearing on the resolution of this market.\n\nThis market may only resolve to \"No\" once the first data point after March 7, 2025 is published. If the first data point after March 7, 2025 is published, and there is still no data point for March 7, this market will resolve according to all prior data points.\n\nPlease note the resolution source reports the rating value to only one decimal point (e.g. 42.8%, 33.9%, etc).
