If the area is not shaded red by August 31, 2025, 11:59 PM ET, the market will resolve to “No”.\n\nIf the territory of municipality is shade light grey, and is distinguished from bordering municipalities such as \"Rih\" with a darker grey line. If all area within the municipality is shaded in red, however the shading does not precisely match up with the border such that there is a tiny amount of grey along the border of the city, this will still qualify for a \"Yes\" resolution. \n\nOnce Russia captures the Pokrovsk, any subsequent loss of control will not be considered towards the resolution of this market.\n\nPokrovsk Location: https://polymarket-upload.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Pokrovosk+Location.png\nLocation on Google Maps: https://maps.app.goo.gl/ixAs4fF8n8ccVeL17\n\nThe primary resolution source for this market will be the ISW Ukraine map.
