Otherwise, this market will resolve to \"No\".\n\nFor the purpose of resolving this market, the 'margin of victory' is defined as the absolute difference between the percentages of votes received by the first and second-place candidate. Percentages of the votes received by each candidate will be determined by dividing the total number of votes each of the top two candidates receives by the sum of all votes cast in Romanian Presidential Election runoff.\n\nThis market will resolve based off the official vote count once the votes count has been made official.\n\nIf a recount is initiated before the vote total has been made official, the market will remain open until the recount is completed and the vote is made official.\n\nThis market will resolve based on the official results of the election, as reported by a consensus of credible reporting. If there is ambiguity, this market resolves based on the election results from the Romanian Government, specifically the Permanent Electoral Authority (https://www.roaep.ro/prezentare/).", "outcomes": "[\"Yes\", \"No\"]", "outcomePrices": "[\"0\", \"1\"]", "volume": "715787.402768", "active": true, "closed": true, "marketMakerAddress": "", "createdAt": "2024-12-04T22:59:27.651128Z", "updatedAt": "2025-05-20T08:20:23.780434Z", "closedTime": "2025-05-19 08:55:31+00", "new": false, "featured": false, "submitted_by": "0x91430CaD2d3975766499717fA0D66A78D814E5c5", "archived": false, "resolvedBy": "0x2F5e3684cb1F318ec51b00Edba38d79Ac2c0aA9d", "restricted": true, "groupItemTitle": "Georgescu by 10% or more", "groupItemThreshold": "0", "questionID": "0xaabe520086374bb6af18af2e271b48db5f2ff25a8ebaaea7f73c73824d7f3000", "umaEndDate": "2025-05-19T08:55:31Z", "enableOrderBook": true, "orderPriceMinTickSize": 0.001, "orderMinSize": 5, "umaResolutionStatus": "resolved", "volumeNum": 715787.402768, "endDateIso": "2024-12-08", "startDateIso": "2024-12-05", "hasReviewedDates": true, "volume1wk": 467662.586666, "volume1mo": 509662.65186399996, "volume1yr": 715787.4027680001, "clobTokenIds": "[\"21558504445911356928607841612776695775669791722221231770770600599666381012988\", \"97336380497450263102061856531053171802552094591021598784019394293993372938738\"]", "umaBond": "500", "umaReward": "5", "volume1wkClob": 467662.586666, "volume1moClob": 509662.65186399996, "volume1yrClob": 715787.4027680001, "volumeClob": 715787.402768, "acceptingOrders": false, "negRisk": true, "negRiskMarketID": "0xaabe520086374bb6af18af2e271b48db5f2ff25a8ebaaea7f73c73824d7f3000", "negRiskRequestID": "0x384431c598a8d13baa31c48d8260f3fedf1aa56f3c6d7fb6da176cbb175c6b29", "events": [{"id": "15082", "ticker": "romania-presidential-election-margin-of-victory", "slug": "romania-presidential-election-margin-of-victory", "title": "Old Presidential Election of Romania Margin of Victory?", "description": "This is a market on the margin of victory in the upcoming Romania Presidential Election.", "resolutionSource": "", "startDate": "2024-12-05T00:35:34.765806Z", "creationDate": "2024-12-05T00:35:34.765804Z", "endDate": "2025-12-31T12:00:00Z", "image": "https://polymarket-upload.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/romania-presidential-election-margin-of-victory-xQKNT9KMeXFU.jpg", "icon": "https://polymarket-upload.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/romania-presidential-election-margin-of-victory-xQKNT9KMeXFU.jpg", "active": true, "closed": true, "archived": false, "new": false, "featured": false, "restricted": true, "volume": 1651173.284708, "openInterest": 0, "createdAt": "2024-12-04T18:18:38.338983Z", "updatedAt": "2025-05-20T08:20:26.094814Z", "volume1wk": 475854.768666, "volume1mo": 581251.9693669999, "volume1yr": 1651173.284708, "enableOrderBook": true, "negRisk": true, "negRiskMarketID": "0xaabe520086374bb6af18af2e271b48db5f2ff25a8ebaaea7f73c73824d7f3000", "commentCount": 77, "cyom": false, "closedTime": "2025-05-19T09:05:11Z", "showAllOutcomes": true, "showMarketImages": true, "automaticallyResolved": true, "enableNegRisk": true, "automaticallyActive": true, "gmpChartMode": "default", "negRiskAugmented": false, "pendingDeployment": false, "deploying": false}], "ready": false, "funded": false, "acceptingOrdersTimestamp": "2024-12-05T00:28:12Z", "cyom": false, "pagerDutyNotificationEnabled": false, "approved": true, "rewardsMinSize": 50, "rewardsMaxSpread": 3.5, "spread": 0.001, "automaticallyResolved": true, "oneDayPriceChange": -0.005, "oneWeekPriceChange": -0.005, "oneMonthPriceChange": -0.011, "lastTradePrice": 1, "bestAsk": 0.001, "automaticallyActive": true, "clearBookOnStart": true, "seriesColor": "", "showGmpSeries": false, "showGmpOutcome": false, "manualActivation": false, "negRiskOther": false, "umaResolutionStatuses": "[\"proposed\", \"resolved\"]", "pendingDeployment": false, "deploying": false, "rfqEnabled": false, "holdingRewardsEnabled": false, "feesEnabled": false}
