Elections for the National Assembly, which is the lower house of France's bicameral parliament, are conducted every 5 years over 2 rounds of voting. A single representative is chosen for each of 577 constituencies, and the sum total of representatives makes up the National Assembly. \n\nFollowing Emmanuel Macron's reelection to the French Presidency, his party \"La République En Marche!\" (often abbreviated to \"LREM\" or \"En Marche!\") changed its name to \"Renaissance\" in an effort to rebrand itself.\n\nGiven there are 577 seats in the National assembly, winning 289 seats or more qualifies as winning an \"outright majority\".\n\nThis market will resolve to \"Yes\" if Emmanuel Macron's political party \"Renaissance\" (formerly \"La République En Marche!\") wins 289 or more seats in the National Assembly during the 2022 French Legislative Election. Otherwise, this market will resolve to \"No\".\n\nIf voting on the 2022 French Legislative Election does not occur by October 1, 2022, this market will resolve to 50-50.\n\nThis market's settlement will be based solely on the numbers for the \"Renaissance\" party, not the coalition of which it is part.\n\nThe settlement of this market will be based on numbers released after any second rounds of voting if they occur. \n\nThe figures for the number of seats each party received will primarily be derived from the table expressing data from the election on the official election results page hosted by the French Ministry of the Interior (https://www.elections.interieur.gouv.fr/resultats/resultats-en-direct), however a consensus of credible reporting may be used.", "resolutionSource": "https://www.elections.interieur.gouv.fr/resultats/resultats-en-direct", "startDate": "2022-06-06T00:00:00Z", "creationDate": "2022-06-06T00:00:00Z", "endDate": "2022-06-20T00:00:00Z", "image": "https://polymarket-upload.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/french+flag+button.png", "icon": "https://polymarket-upload.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/french+flag+button.png", "active": true, "closed": true, "archived": false, "new": false, "featured": false, "restricted": true, "liquidity": 0, "volume": 6410.48, "openInterest": 0, "sortBy": "ascending", "category": "Global Politics", "published_at": "2022-07-27 14:41:15.814+00", "createdAt": "2022-07-27T14:41:15.817Z", "updatedAt": "2024-03-22T01:57:13.897025Z", "competitive": 0, "volume24hr": 0, "volume1wk": 0, "volume1mo": 0, "volume1yr": 0, "liquidityAmm": 0, "liquidityClob": 0, "commentCount": 0, "cyom": false, "closedTime": "2022-07-27T14:41:15.817Z", "showAllOutcomes": false, "showMarketImages": true, "enableNegRisk": false, "negRiskAugmented": false, "pendingDeployment": false, "deploying": false}], "creator": "", "ready": false, "funded": false, "cyom": false, "competitive": 0, "pagerDutyNotificationEnabled": false, "approved": true, "rewardsMinSize": 0, "rewardsMaxSpread": 0, "spread": 1, "oneDayPriceChange": 0, "oneHourPriceChange": 0, "oneWeekPriceChange": 0, "oneMonthPriceChange": 0, "oneYearPriceChange": 0, "lastTradePrice": 0, "bestBid": 0, "bestAsk": 1, "clearBookOnStart": true, "manualActivation": false, "negRiskOther": false, "umaResolutionStatuses": "[]", "pendingDeployment": false, "deploying": false, "rfqEnabled": false, "holdingRewardsEnabled": false, "feesEnabled": false}
