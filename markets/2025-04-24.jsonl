On January 16, Romania's coalition government approved a re-run of the presidential election. It is scheduled for May 4, with a second round on May 18, if no candidate receives an absolute majority of the vote (see: https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/romania-confirms-date-tightens-rules-presidential-election-rerun-2025-01-16/).\n\n\nThis market will resolve according to the candidate that receives the second greatest number of votes in the first round of voting. \n\nIf the results of the first round of the Romanian presidential election are not known by December 31, 2025, 11:59 PM ET, this market will resolve to \"Other.\"\n\nThis market will resolve based on the official results of the election, as reported by a consensus of credible reporting. If there is ambiguity, this market resolves based on the election results from the Romanian Government, specifically the Permanent Electoral Authority (https://www.roaep.ro/prezentare/).\n", "resolutionSource": "", "startDate": "2025-04-24T15:22:30.502523Z", "creationDate": "2025-04-24T15:22:30.50252Z", "endDate": "2025-05-04T12:00:00Z", "image": "https://polymarket-upload.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/romania-presidential-election-1st-round-2nd-place-YDoY22lBpHbn.png", "icon": "https://polymarket-upload.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/romania-presidential-election-1st-round-2nd-place-YDoY22lBpHbn.png", "active": true, "closed": true, "archived": false, "new": false, "featured": false, "restricted": true, "volume": 764358.137363, "openInterest": 0, "sortBy": "price", "createdAt": "2025-04-23T22:42:17.319027Z", "updatedAt": "2025-05-07T00:23:32.060098Z", "volume1wk": 752345.172522, "volume1mo": 764358.1373630001, "volume1yr": 764358.1373630001, "enableOrderBook": true, "negRisk": true, "negRiskMarketID": "0xa0dfeb9f50f89b735cffadae2ce965419c19c82e85d11f64ec97ab3b20dd2800", "commentCount": 41, "cyom": false, "closedTime": "2025-05-05T21:25:51Z", "showAllOutcomes": true, "showMarketImages": false, "automaticallyResolved": true, "enableNegRisk": true, "automaticallyActive": true, "gmpChartMode": "default", "negRiskAugmented": false, "pendingDeployment": false, "deploying": false}], "ready": false, "funded": false, "acceptingOrdersTimestamp": "2025-04-24T15:18:48Z", "cyom": false, "pagerDutyNotificationEnabled": false, "approved": true, "clobRewards": [{"id": "22034", "conditionId": "0x23f386d47d6f1fcc8946dab52e8706ed61af294c716faf443134f877fab093fc", "assetAddress": "0x2791Bca1f2de4661ED88A30C99A7a9449Aa84174", "rewardsAmount": 0, "rewardsDailyRate": 2, "startDate": "2025-04-24", "endDate": "2500-12-31"}], "rewardsMinSize": 100, "rewardsMaxSpread": 3.5, "spread": 0.001, "automaticallyResolved": true, "oneWeekPriceChange": -0.0795, "lastTradePrice": 1, "bestAsk": 0.001, "automaticallyActive": true, "clearBookOnStart": true, "seriesColor": "", "showGmpSeries": false, "showGmpOutcome": false, "manualActivation": false, "negRiskOther": false, "umaResolutionStatuses": "[\"proposed\", \"resolved\"]", "pendingDeployment": false, "deploying": false, "rfqEnabled": false, "holdingRewardsEnabled": false, "feesEnabled": false}
