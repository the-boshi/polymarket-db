Otherwise, this market will resolve to \"No.\"\n\nFor this market to resolve to \"Yes\", it is only necessary that Trump refer to \"blacks\" and \"love\" or \"Hispanics\" and \"love\" exactly, regardless of whether those words are in the same sentence (e.g. \"The blacks. They love me.\" counts). However, the context and clear intent of the statement must indicate that the meaning is that Black or Hispanic people love him.\n\nNote: Trump must specially use the word \"blacks\" or \"Hispanics\". Phrases such as \"black people\" or \"African Americans\" will not qualify.\n\nIf the debate is canceled or rescheduled to a date later than June 27, 2024 ET, this market will resolve to \"No\".\n\nThe resolution source is live video of the debate. In case of ambiguity, an official transcript and/or a consensus of credible reporting may also be considered.\n\n", "outcomes": "[\"Yes\", \"No\"]", "outcomePrices": "[\"0\", \"1\"]", "volume": "35558.897878", "active": true, "closed": true, "marketMakerAddress": "", "createdAt": "2024-06-27T21:28:10.168745Z", "updatedAt": "2024-06-29T09:26:03.937638Z", "closedTime": "2024-06-28 11:27:17+00", "new": false, "featured": false, "submitted_by": "0x91430CaD2d3975766499717fA0D66A78D814E5c5", "archived": false, "resolvedBy": "0x6A9D222616C90FcA5754cd1333cFD9b7fb6a4F74", "restricted": true, "groupItemTitle": "", "groupItemThreshold": "0", "questionID": "0x4f54f39eeea29124a6b3d92736deffab691d402d890a7cc3e61c1c5b51faa766", "umaEndDate": "2024-06-28T11:27:17Z", "enableOrderBook": true, "orderPriceMinTickSize": 0.001, "orderMinSize": 5, "umaResolutionStatus": "resolved", "volumeNum": 35558.9, "endDateIso": "2024-06-27", "startDateIso": "2024-06-27", "hasReviewedDates": true, "volume1wk": 0, "volume1mo": 0, "volume1yr": 0, "clobTokenIds": "[\"7018919466078220450327312242121910024395298967477241858653073567947032034398\", \"50941220029435702414446196581559481281716750025642694574960742369758346163148\"]", "umaBond": "500", "umaReward": "5", "volume1wkAmm": 0, "volume1moAmm": 0, "volume1yrAmm": 0, "volume1wkClob": 0, "volume1moClob": 0, "volume1yrClob": 0, "volumeClob": 35558.897878, "acceptingOrders": false, "negRisk": false, "events": [{"id": "11297", "ticker": "trump-says-blacks-or-hispanics-love-him", "slug": "trump-says-blacks-or-hispanics-love-him", "title": "Trump says \"Blacks\" or \"Hispanics\" love him?", "startDate": "2024-06-27T21:36:10.243721Z", "creationDate": "2024-06-27T21:36:10.243718Z", "endDate": "2024-06-27T12:00:00Z", "image": "https://polymarket-upload.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/trump-says-blacks-or-hispanics-love-him-2fv2iGE-Q3BA.jpg", "icon": "https://polymarket-upload.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/trump-says-blacks-or-hispanics-love-him-2fv2iGE-Q3BA.jpg", "active": true, "closed": true, "archived": false, "new": false, "featured": false, "restricted": true, "volume": 35558.897878, "createdAt": "2024-06-27T21:28:09.446092Z", "updatedAt": "2024-06-29T09:26:04.920959Z", "volume1wk": 0, "volume1mo": 0, "volume1yr": 0, "enableOrderBook": true, "commentCount": 0, "cyom": false, "closedTime": "2024-06-28T11:27:17Z", "showAllOutcomes": true, "showMarketImages": true, "automaticallyResolved": true, "enableNegRisk": false, "negRiskAugmented": false, "pendingDeployment": false, "deploying": false}], "ready": false, "funded": false, "acceptingOrdersTimestamp": "2024-06-27T21:32:08Z", "cyom": false, "pagerDutyNotificationEnabled": false, "approved": true, "clobRewards": [{"id": "2723", "conditionId": "0xfca54646a11ea84414ea7a73793dc8761b0d54a26afa5011e706e23c20d87564", "assetAddress": "0x2791Bca1f2de4661ED88A30C99A7a9449Aa84174", "rewardsAmount": 0, "rewardsDailyRate": 200, "startDate": "2024-06-27", "endDate": "2500-12-31"}], "rewardsMinSize": 20, "rewardsMaxSpread": 3.5, "spread": 0.001, "automaticallyResolved": true, "oneDayPriceChange": 0, "oneHourPriceChange": 0, "oneWeekPriceChange": 0, "oneMonthPriceChange": 0, "oneYearPriceChange": 0, "lastTradePrice": 0, "bestBid": 0, "bestAsk": 1, "clearBookOnStart": true, "manualActivation": false, "negRiskOther": false, "umaResolutionStatuses": "[]", "pendingDeployment": false, "deploying": false, "rfqEnabled": false, "holdingRewardsEnabled": false, "feesEnabled": false}
