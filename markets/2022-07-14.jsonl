The 2022 Open Championship, (officially the 150th Open Championship), will be played July 14-17 in Scotland. It is made up of 156 players who gained entry through various exemption criteria and qualifying tournaments.\n\nLIV Golf, started in June 2022, is a professional golf tour financed by the Public Investment Fund, the sovereign wealth fund of Saudi Arabia. Its emergence and the extraordinary money behind it has plunged the sport into tumult and financial upheaval. It has been criticized by human rights groups as an example of sportswashing by Saudi Arabia. The 'traditional' golf organizations are grappling with how to combat LIV Golf's massive purses for golfers who join the controversial breakout league. \n\nThe controversy looms over the British Open, but despite efforts to disallow the \"LIV players\" from attending future major competitions, they continue to be eligible to compete at the Old Course in Scotland. However, the Royal & Ancient Golf Club of St Andrews that runs the tournament informed the chief executive of the LIV Golf series, Greg Norman, that he was not welcome at any Open events. The \"LIV players\", who are on the LIV Golf roster, are the players considered in this market. Their names are listed below.\n\nThis market will resolve to \"Yes\" if one of the players competing in the LIV Tour, as listed below, wins the 2022 Open Championship and to \"No\" otherwise. If for any reason the winner is not decided by July 24, 2022 (11 PM ET), this market will resolve to \"No\".\n\nPlease note that only the players named in the list below count in this market.
